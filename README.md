# SefariaCLU-T
A command line utility (/tool) for sefaria texts.
# Requirements:
1. A Windows computer (sorry, Mac and Linux!)
2. You are going to need <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/"> Node </a> set up and in your PATH.
That's it!
# Setup:
1. Clone this repo or download the .zip and extract. <br>
2. Copy the path to the folder. This will end in something like "\Downloads\SefariaCLU-T-master\SefariaCLU-T-master" (for the download, at least) if you haven't moved the file.
3. Add that to your PATH (see <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml"> here </a> if you don't know how.)
4. While you are in that "Environment Variables Dialog," create a new User Variable (hint: click "New" :) ) called SEF_PATH with that same copied file path from step 2. However, add "\sef.js" to the end of it.
5. You're good!

#Usage:

1. Open up your CLI (command prompt).
2. Type "sefaria", a space, and a reference in Sefaria. Since spaces are not allowed in a <b>single</b> argument, substitute, as the sefaria urls do, " " for "_" in the book title, and " " for "." everywhere else.
<br><br>
A well written command looks like this: <code>sefaria Job.1:1-5</code>

Have fun!
