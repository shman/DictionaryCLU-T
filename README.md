# DictionaryCLU-T 
A command line utility (/tool) to find definitions in the English language. 
# Requirements:
1. A Windows computer (sorry, Mac and Linux!)
2. You are going to need <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/"> Node </a> set up and in your PATH.
That's it!
# Setup:
1. Clone this repo or download the .zip and extract. <br>
2. Copy the path to the folder. This will end in something like "\Downloads\DictionaryCLU-T-master\DictionaryCLU-T-master" (for the download, at least) if you haven't moved the file.
3. Add that to your PATH (see <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml"> here </a> if you don't know how.)
4. While you are in that "Environment Variables Dialog," create a new User Variable (hint: click "New" :) ) called DICT_PATH with that same copied file path from step 2. However, add "\dict.js" to the end of it.
5. You're good!

#Usage:

1. Open up your CLI (command prompt).
2. Type "define", a space, and a word in English.

A well written command looks like this: <code>define besmeared</code>

Have fun!
